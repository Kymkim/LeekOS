Hello! This is my custom NixOS config! 

This is still under development and there are alot of things I need to work on. I try to improve it every single day :)

Suggestions? I'm still learning Nix and I'm always to learn something new. Feel free to reach out! 

# Feb25 Update:
- I thought the old configuration got very disorganized. I was trying to organize it to fine granuality that I have almost literally have a module for each packages. So I decided to nuke everything and start from scratch again!
- New stuff in this month:
    - Framework 16 base configuration to get everything up and running
    - Live Wallpaper Support using Wallpaper Engine and linux-wallpaperengine
    - Some basic Hyprland theming
