This is my custom NixOs configuration -- the LeekOS (Previously called HyprMikuOS). I thought it was a more clever name and more subtle. Ths reason to the rename and huge revision was that it was completely gotten extremely unorganized. 

I was spending too much time trying to make a module for every single thing -- in the end i have a huge pile of modules that I have to activate one by one. It is similar to having a switch for every function of your house. Sure, for turning lights with a switch makes sense -- but I don't want a physical switch to be able to open a door or flush the toilet.

Bad analogy aside, this is pratically like my old configuration but with some reorganization with the modules. I have to start from scratch and rebuild from the ground up.

In all honesty, the progress for this repo has significatly plateaued. This is mainly because of college taking most of my free time -- and other projects that I am working on. 

However, this does not mean I don't try to improve this config. From time to time there might be some updates to add more quality of life improvements, desktop environment updates, and so on.

It would just be... uh... slow.
